## A Note on Data Collection
Vendors were retrieved from the [Black Hat 2018 Business Hall Floorplan](http://www.expocad.com/host/fx/ubm/18blckh/exfx.html#exhibitors), and exclude any Federal agencies, educational organizations, or nonprofits. I also excluded any companies in the Career Zone, as they are aiming to recruit security talent rather than sell products or servicesâ€Š(for example, I presume Major League Baseball is not selling the latest Threat Intelligence Automation on the Blockchain.)
